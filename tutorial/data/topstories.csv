Regatta Storage is a new cloud file system that provides unlimited pay-as-you-go capacity, local-like performance, and automatic synchronization to S3-compatible storage. For example, you can use Regatta to instantly access massive data sets in S3 with Spark, Pytorch, or pandas without paying for large, local disks or waiting for the data to download.<p>Check out an overview of how the service works here: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=xh1q5p7E4JY"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=xh1q5p7E4JY</a>, and you can try it for free at <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;regattastorage.com"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;regattastorage.com</a> after signing up for an account. We wanted to let you try it without an account, but we figured that “Hacker News shares a file system and S3 bucket” wouldn’t be the best experience for the community.<p>I built Regatta after spending nearly a decade building and operating at-scale cloud storage at places like Amazon’s Elastic File System (EFS) and Netflix. During my 8 years at EFS, I learned a lot about how teams thought about their storage usage. Users frequently told me that they loved how simple and scalable EFS was, and -- like S3 -- they didn’t have to guess how much capacity they needed up front.<p>When I got to Netflix, I was surprised that there wasn’t more usage of EFS. If you looked around, it seemed like a natural fit. Every application needed a POSIX file system. Lots of applications had unclear or spikey storage needs. Often, developers wanted their storage to last beyond the lifetime of an individual instance or container. In fact, if you looked across all Netflix applications, some ridiculous amount of money was being spent on <i>empty storage space</i> because each of these local drives had to be overprovisioned for potential usage.<p>I tried to evangelize EFS, but I got consistent pushback. Other engineers told me that NFS was slow or chatty and couldn’t deliver adequate performance for their applications. Most of these applications were transferring data from S3 for analysis, and then uploading some set of results. Using EFS as the backing storage system meant that the teams would need to “clean up” this temporary data when the jobs were done.<p>At this point, I realized that there was a missing solution in the cloud storage market which wasn’t being filled by either block or file storage, and I decided to build Regatta.<p>Regatta is a pay-as-you-go cloud file system that automatically expands with your application. Because it automatically synchronizes with S3 using native file formats, you can connect it to existing data sets and use recently written file data directly from S3. When data isn’t actively being used, it’s removed from the Regatta cache, so you only pay for the backing S3 storage. Finally, we’re developing a custom file protocol which allows us to achieve local-like performance for small-file workloads <i>and</i> Lustre-like scale-out performance for distributed data jobs.<p>Under the hood, customers mount a Regatta file system by connecting to our fleet of caching instances over NFSv3 (soon, our custom protocol). Our instances then connect to the customer’s S3 bucket on the backend, and provide sub-millisecond cached-read and write performance. This durable cache allows us to provide a strongly consistent, efficient view of the file system to all connected file clients. We can perform challenging operations (like directory renaming) quickly and durably, while they asynchronously propagate to the S3 bucket.<p>We’re excited to see users share our vision for Regatta. We have teams who are using us to build totally serverless Jupyter notebook servers for their AI researchers who prefer to upload and share data using the S3 web UI. We have teams who are using us as a distributed caching layer on top of S3 for low-latency access to common files. We have teams who are replacing their thin-provisioned Ceph boot volumes with Regatta for significant savings. We can’t wait to see what other things people will build and we hope you’ll give us a try at regattastorage.com.<p>We’d love to get any early feedback from the community, ideas for future direction, or experiences in this space. I’ll be in the comments for the next few hours to respond!",1731948549,"Launch HN: Regatta Storage (YC F24) – Turn S3 into a local-like, POSIX cloud FS",story,

We’re Antonio, Luca, and Yuhang, and we’re excited to introduce Fast GraphRAG, an open-source RAG approach that leverages knowledge graphs and the 25 years old PageRank for better information retrieval and reasoning.<p>Building a good RAG pipeline these days takes a lot of manual optimizations. Most engineers intuitively start from naive RAG: throw everything in a vector database and hope that semantic search is powerful enough. This can work for use cases where accuracy isn’t too important and hallucinations are tolerable, but it doesn’t work for more difficult queries that involve multi-hop reasoning or more advanced domain understanding. Also, it’s impossible to debug it.<p>To address these limitations, many engineers find themselves adding extra layers like agent-based preprocessing, custom embeddings, reranking mechanisms, and hybrid search strategies. Much like the early days of machine learning when we manually crafted feature vectors to squeeze out marginal gains, building an effective RAG system often becomes an exercise in crafting engineering “hacks.”<p>Earlier this year, Microsoft seeded the idea of using Knowledge Graphs for RAG and published GraphRAG - i.e. RAG with Knowledge Graphs. We believe that there is an incredible potential in this idea, but existing implementations are naive in the way they create and explore the graph. That’s why we developed Fast GraphRAG with a new algorithmic approach using good old PageRank.<p>There are two main challenges when building a reliable RAG system:<p>(1) Data Noise: Real-world data is often messy. Customer support tickets, chat logs, and other conversational data can include a lot of irrelevant information. If you push noisy data into a vector database, you’re likely to get noisy results.<p>(2) Domain Specialization: For complex use cases, a RAG system must understand the domain-specific context. This requires creating representations that capture not just the words but the deeper relationships and structures within the data.<p>Our solution builds on these insights by incorporating knowledge graphs into the RAG pipeline. Knowledge graphs store entities and their relationships, and can help structure data in a way that enables more accurate and context-aware information retrieval. 12 years ago Google announced the knowledge graph we all know about [1]. It was a pioneering move. Now we have LLMs, meaning that people can finally do RAG on their own data with tools that can be as powerful as Google’s original idea.<p>Before we built this, Antonio was at Amazon, while Luca and Yuhang were finishing their PhDs at Oxford. We had been thinking about this problem for years and we always loved the parallel between pagerank and the human memory [2]. We believe that searching for memories is incredibly similar to searching the web.<p>Here’s how it works:<p>- Entity and Relationship Extraction: Fast GraphRAG uses LLMs to extract entities and their relationships from your data and stores them in a graph format [3].<p>- Query Processing: When you make a query, Fast GraphRAG starts by finding the most relevant entities using vector search, then runs a personalized PageRank algorithm to determine the most important “memories” or pieces of information related to the query [4].<p>- Incremental Updates: Unlike other graph-based RAG systems, Fast GraphRAG natively supports incremental data insertions. This means you can continuously add new data without reprocessing the entire graph.<p>- Faster: These design choices make our algorithm faster and more affordable to run than other graph-based RAG systems because we eliminate the need for communities and clustering.<p>Suppose you’re analyzing a book and want to focus on character interactions, locations, and significant events:<p><pre><code>  from fast_graphrag import GraphRAG
  
  DOMAIN = &quot;Analyze this story and identify the characters. Focus on how they interact with each other, the locations they explore, and their relationships.&quot;

This code creates a domain-specific knowledge graph based on your data, example queries, and specified entity types. Then you can query it in plain English while it automatically handles all the data fetching, entity extractions, co-reference resolutions, memory elections, etc. When you add new data, locking and checkpointing is handled for you as well.<p>This is the kind of infrastructure that GenAI apps need to handle large-scale real-world data. Our goal is to give you this infrastructure so that you can focus on what’s important: building great apps for your users without having to care about manually engineering a retrieval pipeline. In the managed service, we also have a suite of UI tools for you to explore and debug your knowledge graph.<p>We have a free hosted solution with up to 100 monthly requests.

Just hover, click, and start tweaking any HTML. Also, certain elements you click will have special easy edit abilities:<p>- &lt;img&gt; auto creates an uploader, stock photo picker (or HTML)<p>- &lt;video&gt; auto creates an uploader, stock video picker (or HTML)<p>- &lt;svg&gt; auto creates a big icon picker (or HTML)<p>- &lt;div class=&quot;prose&quot;&gt; auto creates a WYSIWYG Editor (or HTML)<p>2) Slices<p>Think of these as just individual HTML sections of a page or lil baby single-file components. They are self-contained and isolated so you drag them around easily. The real power comes from reuse across your pages and linking them (aka, one HTML footer updates globally). You can also use &quot;slices&quot; from any other tips.io project for quickly expanding your site with more design options.<p>3) AI Elements, Not Pages<p>Another cool concept is you can select any element on an HTML slice an edit that individually vs re-streaming&#x2F;rebuilding and entire component every time. We support 5 different AI models right now. Some other really intense&#x2F;cool AI integration is coming soon.<p>4) Tailwind Everything, No Build Step, &amp; Theming<p>We have a custom &quot;themer&quot; to make creating Tailwind config files near instant with real-time font trying, color palettes&#x2F;preset trying, and more.

This is most concretely visible in our major architectural choices:<p>1. All data allocated on the JavaScript heap is placed into a type-specific vector. Numbers go into the numbers vector, strings into the strings vector, and so on.<p>2. All heap references are type-discriminated indexes: A heap number is identified by its discriminant value and the index to which it points to in the numbers vector.<p>3. Objects are also split up into object kind -specific vectors. Ordinary objects go into one vector, Arrays go into another, DataViews into yet another, and so on.<p>4. Unordinary objects&#x27; heap data does not contain ordinary object data but instead they contain an optional index to the ordinary objects vector.<p>5. Objects are aggressively split into parts to avoid common use-cases having to reading parts that are known to be unused.<p>If this sounds interesting, I&#x27;ve written a few blog posts on the internals of Nova over in our blog, you can jump into that here: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;trynova.dev&#x2F;blog&#x2F;what-is-the-nova-javascript-engine"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;trynova.dev&#x2F;blog&#x2F;what-is-the-nova-javascript-engine</a>",1731884845,Show HN: Nova JavaScript Engine,story,https://github.com/trynova/nova

It’s now on the App Store, but I want to be upfront—it’s still very much in its early stages, with a lot more to go.<p>I was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes while rowing competitively, and that moment changed everything. It wasn’t just the practical challenges of managing insulin, carb counts, and blood sugars; it fundamentally shifted how I see myself and the world. It forced me to slow down, prioritise my health, and take control in ways I never had to before. My outlook on life became more focused on resilience, adaptability, and finding solutions to problems that truly matter.<p>This app started as a pet project over the summer, a way to see what I could create using ChatGPT and explore the potential of LLMs to help with real-world challenges. At first, it was just about making my own diabetes management easier—understanding patterns in blood sugars, planning meals, and adjusting routines. But as I worked on it, I realised it could do more.<p>Right now, Islet offers personalised meal suggestions, tracks activity, and provides basic insights based on the data you enter. It’s far from complete. Even so, the process of building Islet has already taught me so much about how powerful AI can be in creating personal, meaningful tools.<p>This project is deeply tied to how my diagnosis changed me. It’s about more than managing diabetes, it’s about showing how anyone, even a student experimenting over the summer, can use AI to potentially solve real, personal problems. I believe tools like LLMs have the power to democratise solutions for all, making life just a bit easier for all of us.<p>If you’re curious, you can check it out here: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;gb&#x2F;app&#x2F;islet-diabetes&#x2F;id6453168642"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;gb&#x2F;app&#x2F;islet-diabetes&#x2F;id6453168642</a>. I’d love to hear your thoughts what works, what doesn’t, and what features you think would make it better. Your input could help shape the next steps for Islet.<p>Thanks for reading !<p>joshua",1731888475,Show HN: The App I Built to Help Manage My Diabetes,story,https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/islet-diabetes/id6453168642
